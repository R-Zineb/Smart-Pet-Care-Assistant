Building AI course project

#Summary

Smart Pet Care Assistant is an AI tool that helps pet owners monitor their pets’ health and happiness by analyzing behavior, food intake, and activity. It gives simple alerts and tips to keep pets healthier and happier.

Background

Many pet owners struggle to understand if their pets are healthy, bored, or stressed. Animals cannot talk, so problems like illness or anxiety often go unnoticed until they become serious.

This project helps with:

Detecting unusual pet behavior

Preventing health problems early

Helping busy pet owners care better for their animals

I chose this topic because pets are important family members, and many people want to give them better care but don’t always know how.

How is it used?

The user connects a phone app or a small pet tracker (collar or camera) to the system. The AI analyzes:

How much the pet moves

When it eats

How long it sleeps

How it behaves (e.g., pacing, barking, hiding)

The system then shows:

Simple daily reports

Warnings like “Your dog is less active than usual”

Tips such as “Try more playtime today”

This can be used at home by pet owners, vets, or shelters.

Data sources and AI methods

The data could come from:

Pet activity trackers

Phone cameras

Manual input from owners

The AI would use:

Machine learning to detect patterns

Classification to tell normal vs unusual behavior

Simple prediction models to warn about possible health issues

Challenges

This project cannot:

Diagnose diseases with 100% accuracy

Replace a real veterinarian

Work well if the data is missing or incorrect

There are also privacy concerns because cameras and trackers collect personal data, so this must be handled carefully.

What next?

The project could grow by:

Adding more types of pets (cats, dogs, birds)

Connecting to vet clinics

Improving predictions with more data

Adding voice alerts and mobile notifications
